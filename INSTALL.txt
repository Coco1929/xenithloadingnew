1.First of all, make sure that your server matches the requirements:

- Apache
- PHP 7.1+
- MySQL Server
- PHP Extensions: BCMath, JSON, PDO, XML, Zip

2. Then unzip the contents of the downloaded archive to the root of the folder of your domain and go to the site.

(!) It is very important that the files were in the root folder.
If you need to separate the screen from the site or another script on the main domain, simply create a subdomain (for example, loadindscreen.site.com) This is a free service and it will not take a lot of time.

3. You will see the installation script window. Follow the installation wizard.

4.Carefully check all the data that you enter - if you enter incorrect data, the installation process will have to start over.

5.In the final window of the installation wizard, you will need to enter data from the administrator account. Write down the data so as not to forget.

#Congratulations, you installed Galaxy Tools.#
